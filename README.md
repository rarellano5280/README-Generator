  ## Description
  This project uses node.js to prompt the user with questions. The answers to these questions will ultimately be used to create a quality professional README. The user will have the opportunity to choose a license for this project. Once the license has been chosen this app will generate a license badge that will be displayed in the README. 

  ## Installation
  To install this project you will need to following things installed on your local computer:
* VS CODE
* Node.js

You will can install the NPM node package manager by running the following command in the command line "npm init" if you'd like to autocomplete the questions that are asked you can run "npm init -y" instead. 

  ## Usage
  Once you have installed the npm package manager you can initialize the readme generator by running "node index.js" in the command line. You will then answer all the required questions with the information you'd like to include you new professional README.
